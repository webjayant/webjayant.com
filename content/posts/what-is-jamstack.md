**What is JAMstack and why should I care?**

JAMstack is a modern web-development architecture that contains strictly client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt markup. With JAMstack, developers can develop apps only using front-end technologies without setting up servers and back-end.\
Thanks to recent development of serverless platforms such as firebase, Google Cloud Functions, Amazon Lambda Functions which enables API integrations from front-end itself.

The best thing about JAMstack in my opinion is the that you don't have to pay any initial amount to get started.

**Why I like JAMstack so much?**

My first interaction to JAMstack I would say was when I was experimenting with [Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow "Dialofflow"). I developed a small [chatbot](vocabguru-3ac8e.web.app "Vocabguru"), used Google Cloud Functions as backend,  deployed it firebase hosting (all without paying any money).

This website (inspired by [brevifolia-gatsby-forestry](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/kendallstrautman/brevifolia-gatsby-forestry "brevifolia")) you are on ([webjayant](https://webjayant.com/ "webjayant")); Developed using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/ "Gatsby"), and [forestry CMS](https://forestry.io/ "Forestry"); deployed on Netlify.

JAMstack gives power to front-end developers to experiment and expand.

**JAMstack main features**

1. **Performance**

   Since the site is build in JavaScript, it gives a major speed advantage when loaded from CDN.
2. **No Back-end Needed**

   Not having to manage your own back-end infrastructure saves time, effort, and cost.
3. **Security**

   As we are using third party APIs developed by domain experts, security is never a concern
4. **Ease of development**

   Using third party services to handle most of the initial setup, it gives us the freedom to focus on more important aspects.
